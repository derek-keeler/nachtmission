Awake: Here you setup the component you are on right now (the "this" object)
Start: Here you setup things that depend on other components.

if you split it that way you can always be sure that the other object is ready to work with you as game objects in scenes on scene load are loaded in blocks:

1. All awake are executed
2. All start are executed
3. all go into update

To make the moon static in the background, it would have to go far into the
distance and the draw distance (camera far plane) would have to go that far.
Instead, put the moon just behind the mountains and lock the moon on the camera.
    - probably better to put it in the skybox

Lessons learned:

At first, when I was iterating on importing Blender models, I would delete the old prefab, then the fbx, then reimport and start over. That sucks because you lose all the work you did on the prefab. You can actually leave an object in the scene (maybe don't even need to do this, just keep the prefab), delete the fbx, and reimport. Now, as long as you didn't make any drastic/breaking changes to the model, all your changes will come back. If you do get weird results, then you probably need to make a new prefab. This may be a better way still: https://answers.unity.com/questions/8838/how-can-i-keep-the-prefab-connection-when-re-expor.html

TODO:
    - Chopper: fix clipping into ground
    - Jet:
        - add jet crash
*       - add other attacks
    - Prison: move fire inwards, thicken smoke so you can see the fire through the smoke, but the smoke hides the spawning of the prisoners
    - Prisoner: add a couple more prefabs, random guys come out
        - technically should keep track so the same guys come out when unloading
    - General:
        - try using forces to move objects instead of math
*       - replace launcher icon
        - make destroyed objects fade away after a time instead of just disappearing
        - replace score text with icons
        - make river flow
        - use sound length to destroy sounds as soon as they're done
